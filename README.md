# Lettuce Growth Data Analysis 🌱

This is a data analytics project from the Google Data Analytics Certification. It explores how environmental factors influence the growth time of lettuce plants using spreadsheet-based analysis.


 📊 Project Overview

Tools Used: Google Sheets,  
Dataset Source: [Kaggle - Lettuce Growth Days](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
Project Duration: June 24–26, 2025

✅ SMART Questions Answered

- Specific: Is there a connection between humidity and temperature?
- Measurable: How much growth is normal over a one-week period?
- Action-oriented: Does increasing TDS speed up maturity?
- Relevant: Can we predict lettuce growth based on conditions?
- Time-bound: What is the dataset’s date range and seasonal relevance?

---

 📂 Key Deliverables

- ✅ Cleaned dataset (Excel format)
- ✅ Summary statistics & correlations
- ✅ Visualizations (scatter plots, histogram, time series)
- ✅ Formal [Statement of Work (SOW)]

 📈 Sample Insights

- TDS and pH levels had weak correlations with growth duration
- Lettuce typically matures between 25–35 days
- Dataset covers Aug 3 – Sept 17, 2023, helpful for late-summer planning
